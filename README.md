# Jetchat

## Introduction
Jetchat is a chat application, developed specifically for Android.

This project is developed using Jetpack Compose and Firebase.

I started this project for the sole purpose of learning Android development.

## Key learning points (which I hope to pick up)
1. A rough understanding of the Android ecosystem (in the eyes of a developer)
2. Kotlin's language construct
3. Concurrency concepts in Kotlin (e.g. Coroutines)
4. MVVM with Jetpack Compose 
5. Dependency Injection using Hilt
6. Gradle build system
